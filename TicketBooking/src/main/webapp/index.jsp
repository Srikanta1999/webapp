			<p>Train journeys hold a unique charm, especially when they lead to enchanting destinations like Shimla. However, what makes the journey even more captivating is the special toy train that runs from Kalka to Shimla, winding through breathtaking landscapes. A trip to Shimla remains incomplete without experiencing this iconic train ride. Thus, we planned our Shimla trip well in advance and secured our tickets for this much-talked-about train journey.

Our Journey to Shimla by Toy Train During last year’s autumn break, we embarked on a memorable journey to Shimla. We began our travel by bus to Kalka, the starting point of our adventure with the toy train. Initially, I expected it to be just another train journey, offering glimpses of mountains and valleys. However, it turned out to be an exhilarating and extraordinary experience. Throughout our journey, we found ourselves immersed in the lap of nature, not merely observing the mountains, valleys, and lush greenery, but feeling like an integral part of this natural wonder as the train gracefully traversed the mountains.
Spanning a duration of 5-6 hours, this journey was filled with thrills and excitement. The route featured a multitude of tunnels and bridges that added to the allure. There were more than 100 tunnels and approximately 800 bridges along the route. I remained glued to the window seat, relishing the splendid vistas outside. At one point, the train made a brief stop at a quaint station, affording us a brief ten-minute break to explore.
Throughout the journey, my parents and brother shared in my delight, finding it as enjoyable as I did. We chose the same train for our return journey, unwilling to miss out on a second opportunity to savor this captivating experience.
Conclusion Undoubtedly, this tain journey stands out as the most remarkable one in my life. My deep love for nature made this journey even more special. I sincerely hope for a chance to traverse this enchanting route once more, as it left an indelible mark on my heart.
